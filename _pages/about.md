    <h1>Sports & Outdoors</h1>
    <p>Sports and outdoor activities have always been a fun part of my life. I have a deep passion for biking, whether it's mountain biking, road biking, or simply riding around town for errands. I bike during all four seasons, but I keep a close watch on the weather and road conditions. My cycling adventures have taken me on long rides, such as a 78km journey with a 1431m elevation gain. My personal highest annual record of biking is an impressive 2,607km. Beyond biking, I also enjoy hiking, longboarding, and walking, which allow me to explore nature and stay active. To add more, I even go Geocache occasionally. The highest one I have found was at an elevation of 2,408 meters, which required a 22km hike.</p>
    <p>In addition to those activities, I am an enthusiastic participant in a sports team. My team play in various sports, and I joined their soccer, track and field, and basketball. During the winter months, I embrace the cold by taking part in cross country skiing. These sports have not only helped me stay fit but also taught me valuable lessons in teamwork, perseverance, and integrity. Engaging in a variety of sports keeps me motivated and ensures that I am always challenging myself to reach new heights.</p>
