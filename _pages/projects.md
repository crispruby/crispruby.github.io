3D Modelling
============
I have designed many types of 3D objects, including tools, cups, castles, towers, lids, etc.

Tetris
======
I played Tetris before, so I used Unity and developed a colourful design of **[Tetris](https://captain-garneto.itch.io/tetris-coursera)** myself. This design is available for free, inlcuding the [source code](https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-Tetris). It can be played on the browser.

3D Game Development
===================
Learning how to use **C#** and **Unity**, I created two 3-dimensional games. I developed several levels and with sounds. The first one, **[Bugs of Planet Dune](https://captain-garneto.itch.io/bugs-of-planet-dune)**, is a game for shooting the giant bugs, finding keys, and escaping through the portals. The [source code](https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-Bugs-of-Planet-Dune) is publicly available on my github. The second one, **[Commander Ruby's Journeys](https://captain-garneto.itch.io/commander)** is a game where the commander player is to jump over enemies, find portal keys, and find the hidden treasures. The [source code](https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-Commander-Ruby-on-Journey) is available on my github account. Both are free to play. They can be played on the browser.

2D Game Development
===================
Learning about **Unity**, I created a couple of video games. Both were 2-dimensional with sounds, and I created several levels in both. The first one, **[Galaxy Battle](https://captain-garneto.itch.io/galaxy-battle)**, was designed for leading your starship around on the player's screen and shooting the enemies. The [source code](https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-Space-Blaster) is available on my github account. The second one, **[King of Time Travel](https://captain-garneto.itch.io/king-of-time-travel)**, was designed with a mix of animation between castles and starships. The player's avatar is a king who is searching for keystones to unlock the doors, and find the locked treasure. The [source code](https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-King-of-Time-Travel) is publicly accessible on my github account. Both are free to play, even on the browser.

Solar System Simulation
=======================
Exploring **Virtual Reality**, I took several courses and created a simulation of our own **Solar System**. It is an educational simulation for learning about the planets, moons, and comets. It is [available](https://captain-garneto.itch.io/solar-system-simulator) for free, including the [source code](https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-Virtual-Solar-System).
