3D Modelling
============
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>I have designed many types of 3D objects, including tools, cups, castles, towers, lids, etc. To search my 3D models, go to my <strong><a href="https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/DigitalShopOfGoodies">Digital Shop of Goodies</a></strong> on Etsy. </p>

Tetris
======
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>I played Tetris before, so I used Unity and developed a colourful design of <strong><a href="https://captain-garneto.itch.io/tetris-coursera">Tetris</a></strong> myself. This design is available for free, including the <a href="https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-Tetris">source code</a>. It can be played on the browser.</p>

3D Game Development
===================
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
<p>Learning how to use <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>Unity</strong>, I created two 3-dimensional games. I developed several levels. The first one, <a href="https://captain-garneto.itch.io/bugs-of-planet-dune"><strong>Bugs of Planet Dune</strong></a>, is a game for shooting the giant bugs, finding keys, and escaping through the portals. The <a href="https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-Bugs-of-Planet-Dune">source code</a> is publicly available on my github. The second one, <a href="https://captain-garneto.itch.io/commander"><strong>Commander Ruby's Journeys</strong></a> is a game where the commander player is to jump over enemies, find portal keys, and find the hidden treasures. The <a href="https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-Commander-Ruby-on-Journey">source code</a> is available on my github account. Both are free to play. They can be played on the browser.</p>

2D Game Development
===================
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>Learning about <strong>Unity</strong>, I created a couple of video games. Both were 2-dimensional, and I created several levels in both. The first one, <a href="https://captain-garneto.itch.io/galaxy-battle"><strong>Galaxy Battle</strong></a>, was designed for leading your starship around on the player's screen and shooting the enemies. The <a href="https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-Space-Blaster">source code</a> is available on my github account. The second one, <a href="https://captain-garneto.itch.io/king-of-time-travel"><strong>King of Time Travel</strong></a>, was designed with a mix of animation between castles and starships. The player's avatar is a king who is searching for keystones to unlock the doors, and find the locked treasure. The <a href="https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-King-of-Time-Travel">source code</a> is publicly accessible on my github account. Both are free to play, even on the browser.</p>

Solar System Simulation
=======================
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>Exploring <strong>Virtual Reality</strong>, I took several courses and created a simulation of our own <strong>Solar System</strong>. It is an educational simulation for learning about the planets, moons, and comets. It is <a href="https://captain-garneto.itch.io/solar-system-simulator">available</a> for free, including the <a href="https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-Virtual-Solar-System">source code</a>.</p>
