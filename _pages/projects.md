Solar System Simulation
=======================
Exploring **Virtual Reality**, I took several courses and created a simulation of our own **Solar System**. It is an educational simulation for learning about the planets, moons, and comets. It is [available](https://captain-garneto.itch.io/solar-system-simulator) for free.
