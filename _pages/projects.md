3D Modeling
============
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>I have designed a variety of 3D models, including tools, cups, castles, towers, lids, and more. To explore my 3D models, visit my <strong><a href="https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/DigitalShopOfGoodies">Digital Shop of Goodies</a></strong> on Etsy. </p>

Tetris
======
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>Having played Tetris before, I used Unity to develop a colorful version of <strong><a href="https://captain-garneto.itch.io/tetris-coursera">Tetris</a></strong> myself. This design is available for free, including the <a href="https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-Tetris">source code</a>, and can be played in the browser.</p>

3D Game Development
===================
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
<p>While learning <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>Unity</strong>, I created two 3-dimensional games. <a href="https://captain-garneto.itch.io/bugs-of-planet-dune"><strong>Bugs of Planet Dune</strong></a>, is a game that involves shooting giant bugs, finding keys, and escaping through gates. The <a href="https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-Bugs-of-Planet-Dune">source code</a> is publicly available on my github account. Within <a href="https://captain-garneto.itch.io/commander"><strong>Commander Ruby's Journeys</strong></a>, the player, as Commander Ruby, jumps over enemies, finds portal keys, and discovers hidden treasures. The <a href="https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-Commander-Ruby-on-Journey">source code</a> is available on my github account. Both games are free to play in the browser.</p>

2D Game Development
===================
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>While learning <strong>Unity</strong>, I created a couple of 2-dimensional video games. <a href="https://captain-garneto.itch.io/galaxy-battle"><strong>Galaxy Battle</strong></a> involves leading your starship around and shooting enemies. The <a href="https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-Space-Blaster">source code</a> is available on my github account. <a href="https://captain-garneto.itch.io/king-of-time-travel"><strong>King of Time Travel</strong></a>features a mix of animation of castles and starships. The player, as a king, searches for keystones to unlock doors and find hidden treasures. The <a href="https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-King-of-Time-Travel">source code</a> is available on my github account. Both games are free to play in the browser.</p>

Solar System Simulation
=======================
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>Exploring <strong>Virtual Reality</strong>, I took several courses and created a simulation of our <strong>Solar System</strong>. This educational simulation helps learners understand the planets, moons, and comets. It is <a href="https://captain-garneto.itch.io/solar-system-simulator">available</a> for free, including the <a href="https://github.com/crispruby/CSharp-Unity-Virtual-Solar-System">source code</a>.</p>
