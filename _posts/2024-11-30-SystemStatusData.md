    <p>During 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to work as a remote contractor for <a href="https://www.quantotechltd.com/"><strong>QuantoTech</strong></a> in Vancouver, British Columbia, for seven months. During my time, I collaborated with an exceptional team to collect and convert system status data, contributing to the seamless operations of our systems. One of the significant projects I was involved in was developing data manipulation software using C# and .NET 8. This project allowed me to improve my skills in creating efficient and user-friendly programs that analyzed and displayed streamlined data in graphs. Using the program, the company monitors the process of their indoor growing.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I gained valuable experience working with various data formats, including JSON and CSV. This hands-on experience also deepened my understanding of data handling and manipulation. My time at QuantoTech was marked by continuous learning, teamwork, and the satisfaction of contributing to innovative solutions that drive the company forward. It was a period of growth and achievement that I am proud to have been a part of.</p>
