    <p>On December 16, 2017, I achieved my 2nd Degree Black Belt of Tae-Kwon-Do. I trained for 12 years. During that time, as an assistant instructor, I taught people of all ages how to do Tae-Kwon-Do for over five years. I built great friendships with them, and some of my earlier friends joined the Martial Arts too.</p>
