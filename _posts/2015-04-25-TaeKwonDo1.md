    <p>On April 25, 2015 I achieved my 1st Degree Black Belt of Tae-Kwon-Do. I trained in class for 10 years and became a Black Belt of Tae-Kwon-Do. I found martial arts as a sport where people of all ages could come to train and help each other. I trained and taught the kids, keeping in the fun.</p>
