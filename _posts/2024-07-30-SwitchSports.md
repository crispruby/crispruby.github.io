    <p>For 15 years, I dedicated myself to practicing Tae-Kwon-Do, achieving the rank of black belt. As an assistant instructor, I had the privilege of teaching for over seven years and even helped out at various tournaments. However, I decided to switch sports due to the pandemic and personal reasons.</p>
    <p>After the pandemic, I discovered a local sports team that offered a variety of sports. Considering the available options, I decided to play basketball, soccer, track and field, and cross-country skiing. For summer competition, I chose track and field. I competed in the regionals and secured a spot in the 2025 provincial competition in British Columbia. For winter sports, I plan to participate in cross-country skiing during the 2026 regional competition. This transition has been incredibly rewarding and has allowed me to develop new skills and experiences in a range of athletic disciplines.</p>
