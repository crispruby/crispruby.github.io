In June 2020 I graduated from **Okanagan College** with a **Bachelor of Computer Information Systems**, along with a Database Systems Specialty and Software Design and Development Specialty. I took 43 courses, and completed one internship at Okanagan College. This extensive coursework and hands-on experience provided me with a solid foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. My time at Okanagan College played a significant role in shaping my career and personal development.
